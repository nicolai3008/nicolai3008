I am a physics engineer the 4th semester of my masters. I am specialized in solid state physics, more specifically neutron scattering, magnetism and software implementation.

Most recently, I spent the summer of 2024 working as a summer student at PSI for the Labratory of Neutron Scattering and Imaging ([LNS](https://www.psi.ch/en/lns)). Specifically I helped design an instrument similar to [CAMEA](https://www.psi.ch/en/sinq/camea), but with a higher resolution, and utilizing a new concept. Along with this I installed an X-ray goniometer on [ZEBRA](https://www.psi.ch/en/sinq/zebra).

**Portfolio:**
- 2024 - WARP Instrument for PSI: High Resolution continuous angle multi-energy instrument
  - Designed own McStas Component
  - Worked at PSI for 2 months to complete this task
- 2024 - SLEIPNER Instrument for ESS: Slender, modular instrument for training, utility and increased beamtime
  - Designed and optimized instrument for proposal for ESS
  - Article to be written
- 2022 - Worked on Magnon Scattering on a simulated BIFROST instrument on McStas

**Fluent in:**

- Python
- MatLab
- C
- JavaScript
- Html/CSS
