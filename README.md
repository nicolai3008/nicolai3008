I am a physics student, reading my bachelor, currently on my 7th semester,
and I have a passion for programming, simulation and automation.

- On the side, I am currently working on developing my web development skills, and am trying to connect with local buissnesses to build their websites
- I have some projects in the work that I hope will be received well
- I am also the coordinator for DTU Physics Open House event, and work as a TA in several different subjects, for students of many different ages
- Renovating my kitchen
